        "Data science without data is not much of a science. In most cases, you can find many great curated clean datasets online (for example Kaggle). Sometimes you need specific data for your project to succeed. How can you collect one? Well, you can always search the web for particular information and manually create your own dataset. Unfortunately, these days many models require quite large data samples and it would be time-consuming and sometimes even impossible to manually collect +10k individual samples to your dataset. Luckily for us, there is one great method that enables us to automate this process. It is called data scraping. This technique is widely used by software agents for different purposes. One of the examples is Google. The software giant goes to every page, scans it, and puts the information into its databases for later indexing."

All information inside HTML documents is presented via [html tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element). There is a large number of HTML tags available but almost all of them share the same properties: they are place of some block inside the document and they format presented information. For example:\n",

Classes are used to group certain elements and apply scripts and styles to them. The same is with ids but the idea is that ids should be unique per document but sadly this is not always the case. Why tags and classes are important to us? We can use them to select parts of the HTML element that we want to extract information from.

Sometimes data will not be presented in pretty preprocessed csv columns and you will need to extract it from various resources by yourself.
